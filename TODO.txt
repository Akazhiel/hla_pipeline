* Add better logging and error handling (general)

* Use snpEff for annotation instead of Annovar (this may make it possible to remove hacks to make the VCFs compatible with Annovar)

* Replace the epitopes generation function by Varcode
* Add k-mer epitope distance as parameter in merge_results.py

* Replace bwa-mem by bwa-mem2
* Add headers in bma mem command (-R) instead of using bedtools
* Add a tool to compute clonality
