* Add better logging and error handling (general)
* Create docker container
* Use snpEff for annotation instead of Annovar (this may make it possible to remove hacks to make the VCFs compatible with Annovar)
* Add QC steps (bamQC, fastQC, vcftools)
* Use jacquard merge instead of GATK3 to merge variants (with this the awk hacks to replace IUPA REF can be removed)
* Add tests
* Replace HLA-LA and arcasHLA by OptiType
* Add a dispatcher to better control creation and destruction of processes
* Replace the peptides/cdna dictionaries in merge_results for a web based tool like bioMart or pyemsembl
  - Al alternative is to use varcode
